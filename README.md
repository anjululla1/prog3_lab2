# prog3_lab2_Java

Write code to print to the console 1,000 randomly generated DNA 3 mers (e.g. “ACA”, “TCG” ).
Where the frequency of A,C,G and T is 25% and is uniformly sampled.

Have your code track how often it prints out the 3 mer (“AAA”) 
How often would you expect to see this 3mer by chance?  Is Java’s number close to the number that you would expect?
